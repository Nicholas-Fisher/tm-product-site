    <h1>NFC</h1>
    <p>For Android, go to settings, find your phone's connection settings, then switch on NFC. An NFC toggle may also be in your quick settings when you drag down the top bar.</p>
    <p>For iPhone 2018+ models, your phone already has NFC enabled by default. If not, you can enable it in settings. For older iPhones you must download a dedicated NFC reader app.</p>
    <p>Once NFC is enabled, hold the top half of your phone to the NFC chip for 3 seconds. The chip is usually near the top rear of the phone. For Samsung phones, it may be closer to the rear center.</p>
